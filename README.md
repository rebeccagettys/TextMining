This is a color frequency analysis tool.  In order to use the tool, simply run run_books.py. This will automatically
analyze the text of Grimm's fairy tales. If you would like to change the colors searched for in these tales, open
text_filter.py and change the strings in COLORS (a global variable) to whatever you would like to be searched.
Automatically, this program will use Grimm's fairy tales as the source for color analysis; in that case, just press
enter during all of the questions. If you would like to change the text used, follow the prompts presented when you run
the program.
